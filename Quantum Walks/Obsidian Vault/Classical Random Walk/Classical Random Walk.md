One of the simplest example of the random walk is the coin flip. Basically, assume we are on a line number where all values are integers. The walker starts at 0. We then flip a coin and, if the result is head, we move right. Otherwise, we move left.
We cannot know for sure where the particle will be at a later time, but we can know the probability of the walker being at a certain position

It's really intuitive to understand these probabilities, so there's no point in going much further explaining *why* these are the probabilities

Here we can see the distribution of a classical random walk on a line for $t=72$, $t=180$ and $t=450$

Not showing the calculations, but the standard deviation is given by:
$$
\sigma(t) = \sqrt{t}
$$
